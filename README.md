# cub3d

Welcome to my cub3D project repository! This project is a part of the curriculum at 42 and serves as an introduction to raycasting and 3D game development concepts. Inspired by the revolutionary game Wolfenstein 3D, cub3D challenges students to create a "realistic" 3D maze game using a simplified form of ray tracing known as raycasting.

Together with my partner [Andrey](https://github.com/42ajakob), we have implemented a basic raycasting engine using the MLX42 library, which provides a set of functions to handle graphics, input, and window management. The engine renders a 3D perspective within a 2D maze, giving the illusion of depth and allowing the player to navigate through the environment in real-time.

Key features of the cub3D project include:

- Raycasting: The core mechanic that allows for the creation of a 3D environment on a 2D plane.

- MLX42 Library: Utilizes this library for efficient graphics rendering and user interaction.

- 3D Maze Navigation: Players can move through a maze, with walls and obstacles rendered in a pseudo-3D perspective.

- Texture Mapping: Walls in the maze are textured to enhance the visual realism of the environment.
